# Type Alias: ProxyAccountDirectoryOverride

> **ProxyAccountDirectoryOverride** = `object`

Test-only replacement for the token store behind the account-exposing
routes. The token store is a module singleton bound to the real home at
import, so a suite cannot redirect it; this lets a case state which logins
exist (`knownKeys`, including disabled ones) and which are routable per
engine, exactly as the real listers would answer.

## Properties

### knownKeys

> **knownKeys**: `Set`\<`string`\>
